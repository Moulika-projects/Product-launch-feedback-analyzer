Title:
🔍 Product Launch Feedback Analyzer using Sentiment Analysis

🧠 Objective:

In today’s digital landscape, understanding customer feedback is essential for successful product launches. This project presents a comprehensive solution that combines overall sentiment analysis with aspect-based sentiment insights using deep learning and NLP techniques.

A pre-trained BERT model was fine-tuned on real-world product review data to classify overall sentiment into Positive, Negative, and Neutral categories. In addition, Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) was implemented using spaCy to extract key product aspects — specifically price and quality — and evaluate sentiment toward each aspect independently. This allows more granular insights beyond general sentiment.

The system also generates automated business recommendations based on aspect sentiment, helping teams take actionable steps such as adjusting pricing or improving product quality. This end-to-end solution supports real-time input and can be adapted for deployment in customer feedback platforms.

🧰 Key Features:

1. ✅ Fine-tuned BERT model for sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral)


2. ✅ Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis using spaCy to identify mentions of price and quality


3. ✅ Real-time predictions for overall sentiment and aspect-specific sentiment


4. ✅ Automated recommendations based on detected sentiment for each aspect

🔧 Tech Stack:

Python, Google Colab

Hugging Face Transformers (BERT)

spaCy (aspect extraction)

PyTorch, Scikit-learn

NLTK (preprocessing)

   
⚠️ Challenges
Despite applying class balancing, and weighted loss, the neutral class remains the hardest to predict accurately. This is a known challenge in sentiment analysis due to the subtle and overlapping nature of neutral statements and aspect based sentiment also less acuurate.

Future improvements could include:

Aspect-specific sentence splitting

Exploring sentence embedding models or RoBERTa
